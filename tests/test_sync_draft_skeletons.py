"""Tests for scripts/sync_draft_skeletons.py — the draft-skeleton generator.

The skeletons restate the templates' field list, and that restatement is the one
part of a draft that can disagree with the schema. It did, silently, and a filled
01_quote.md then yielded no quotation at all. This generator regenerates the
headings from the templates so they cannot disagree; these tests pin the two
properties that make it safe to run: it never loses what a human wrote, and it
reaches a fixed point.
