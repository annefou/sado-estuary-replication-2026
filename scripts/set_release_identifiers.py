"""Write a release's persistent identifiers into this repo's metadata files.

Run once per release, from .github/workflows/release-identifiers.yml. Given the
repository, the tag, and the tag's *commit*, this resolves and records:

  * the **version DOI**  — pins this exact release forever
  * the **concept DOI**  — names the project, resolves to whatever is latest
  * the **SWHID**        — forge-agnostic identity of the exact source tree

into CITATION.cff, codemeta.json and ro-crate-metadata.json, from one lookup,
in one fixed shape.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every one of these identifiers already existed at release time and none of them
were captured. The version DOI was minted by Zenodo alongside the concept DOI
and then dropped on the floor; the SWHID was never even retrieved. What got
recorded, by hand, was the concept DOI — the one identifier that is *designed to
move*. Two repos built from this template recorded the version DOI two different
ways (one a structured CITATION.cff identifier, one a prose comment) because
CITATION.cff said "run /init-template again or edit by hand" and /init-template
deletes itself as its last step. So "edit by hand" was the only surviving path,
and hands improvise.

The distinction is not pedantry. A **concept DOI resolves to the latest
version**. When it appears in a signed, immutable nanopub as "the software that
produced this outcome", the assertion silently starts describing different code
the moment a v0.2.0 is cut — with no signature breakage and no edit path, since
nanopubs can only be retracted or superseded. The **version DOI** is what pins a
snapshot, and it must be what the Outcome and Research Software nanopubs cite.

ROLES (do not mix these up)
---------------------------
  concept DOI  -> CITATION.cff `doi:`         "cite this project"  (floating is CORRECT here)
  version DOI  -> nanopubs, RO-Crate          "this exact code produced this number"
  SWHID        -> preservation-backed identity, survives the forge disappearing

Idempotent: re-running with the same inputs rewrites the same bytes.
