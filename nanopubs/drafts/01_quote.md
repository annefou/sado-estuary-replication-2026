# 01 — Quote-with-comment (paper-rooted chains)

> Run the pre-flight checklist in `docs/forrt-form-fields.md` § Pre-flight checklist before drafting.
>
> If this is a question-rooted chain, use `01_pico.md` or `01_pcc.md` instead — see `docs/chain-decision-tree.md`.
>
> **After choosing the chain shape, delete the two step-1 alternates you aren't using.** Once you've decided this chain is paper-rooted and keep `01_quote.md`, run:
> ```bash
> rm nanopubs/drafts/01_pico.md nanopubs/drafts/01_pcc.md
> ```
